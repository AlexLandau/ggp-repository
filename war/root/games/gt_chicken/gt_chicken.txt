A two player game with simultaneous play in which, in each round,
players choose either to drive straight forward toward each other
or swerve off the road. If both players drive straight forward,
they both crash and receive zero points. If one drives straight
and the other swerves, the player who drove straight wins and gets
five points, and the other player gets three points. If both players
swerve, they each get four points.
