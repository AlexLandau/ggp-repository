Clear all the mines in a cuboid minefield through which the mine-clearer is falling.

At each step, the mine-clearer can optionally move north, south, east or west and then optionally fire a volley of photon torpedoes in one of 4 patterns.

The firing patterns are defined by the offsets from the mine-clearer's current position.

alpha (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)
beta (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)
gamma (-1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0)
delta (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1)

Torpedos destroy all mines which share the relevant (x,y) co-ordinates, irrespective of their depth and how many mines there are sharing the same (x,y) co-ordinates.
