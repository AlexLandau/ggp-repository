(Wikipedia) In nine board tic-tac-toe, nine tic-tac-toe boards are themselves arranged in a 3x3 grid. The first player's move may go on any board; all moves afterwards are placed in the empty spaces on the board corresponding to the square of the previous move (that is, if a move were in the upper-left square of a board, the next move would take place on the upper-left board). If a player cannot move because the indicated board is full, the next move may go on any board. Victory is attained by getting 3 in a row on any board. This makes the game considerably longer and more involved than tic-tac-toe, with a definite opening, middle game and endgame.

In an attempt to remove the significant 1st-player bias, this version includes the "Pie rule".  After the first player has moved, the other player can choose to swap places or to accept the opening move and play as usual.
