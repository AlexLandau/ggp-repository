The game of English draughts, or checkers.

In this version of the game, captures are forced and may be
chained (in this implementation, chains are across multiple
turns).

The game ends when one player cannot move (and loses), or
when twenty turns have passed without a player moving a pawn
or making a capture.

Note that the white player appears as red in the visualization.
