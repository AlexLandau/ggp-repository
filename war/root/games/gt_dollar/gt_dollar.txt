A two player game with alternating play. Each player starts with 16 points.
On their turn, a player may either choose to end the game, or spend one point
in order to "lay claim to the prize" (as long as they have a point to spend).
When the game is ended, the player who last "laid claim to the prize" gets
a prize consisting of five points.

Scores are equal to a player's total points multiplied by five, so that
the maximum score a player can achieve is 100.
