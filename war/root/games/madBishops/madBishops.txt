Mad Bishops is a "game of annihilation" designed by Mark Steere in 2010.

It is played on a 10x10 board that begins with 25 bishops of each color.
The goal of the game is to capture all of the opponent's bishops. Bishops
generally move like chess bishops, but with some restrictions on which
moves can be chosen in a given turn.

Each turn, the active player must make one of the two following types of
moves:
1. Use a bishop to capture an opponent's bishop.
2. Use a bishop that does not have an available capture to move to a
space where it threatens an opposing bishop.

A player wins when all of the opponent's pieces have been captured.
