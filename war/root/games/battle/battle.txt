At each step, each player chooses either to move a piece, or to defend a piece.
Regular checkers may move in one of the four cardinal directions. Kings may move
in any direction, including along diagonals. When a piece moves onto another piece,
the piece being moved on to is captured, unless it is being defended, in which case
the attacking piece is captured. The goal is to capture ten pieces.
