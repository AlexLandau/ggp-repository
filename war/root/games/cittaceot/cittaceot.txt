Cit-Tac-Eot is a game written by the Lés Caméles Froliqué Ìlogicamént team
(Michael Abercrombie, Patrick Grafe, and Peter Pham) from the 2011 edition
of the CS227B class at Stanford. It is a Tic-Tac-Toe style game where you
try to mark five-in-a-row on a 5x5 grid. However, each turn the grid cells
rotate around the center, the inner cells rotating clockwise and the outer
cells rotating counter-clockwise.
