This is an iterated game-theoretical game. In each round, players perform
one of three actions for points.

Their first and second options are calling "heads" or "tails" for a simulated
coin flip. (The caller wins if the choices are the same, the flipper if the choices
are different.) The winner receives ten points, the loser none.

The third option is to refuse to participate in the coin flip. This yields a consistent
one point. The other player receives nine points, unless they also refuse to participate.

The name of the game comes from the implications of choosing to not participate: this
is only rational (risk-neutral) behavior if you think the opponent can read your mind!
