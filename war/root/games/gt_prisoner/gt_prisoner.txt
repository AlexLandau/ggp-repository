A two player game with simultaneous play in which, in each round,
players may either cooperate or defect. Should both players cooperate,
they each receive three points. Should one cooperate and one defect,
the defector receives five points and the cooperator receives zero points.
Should they both defect, they both receive one point. The game is played
for twenty rounds and a player's final score is equal to their accumulated
points at the end.
