Bidding Tic-Tac-Toe is a variant of tic-tac-toe in which players bid for the opportunity
to play moves. Each player starts with three coins, and the first player has a tiebreaker.
Each turn, the players both place bids; the winner makes a move, and the loser receives
all of the coins that were bid, and the tiebreaker if it was used.
